      All moderators can add new files to be ranked. You can let moderators know about a file you wish to see (and a rate) by using the chat box on the home page.

      Either let Wafles/MinaciousGrace know directly, or use the chat box on the home page to report any bugs. We may implement a better method of tracking issues in the future.

    <div id="panel4a" class="content">
      When viewing a file, or passing a file through the ranked difficulty calculator, a file preview is shown along with some graphical data. This feature is incredibly browser intensive on resources and will not work at all in most browsers. As a result this feature is only available in Google Chrome. Sorry for any inconvenience.
